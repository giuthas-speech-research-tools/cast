    Find a 1kHz 50ms beep at the beginning of a sound sample.

    This functions is for processing delayed naming data
    where the go-signal is a 1kHz 50ms beep. The algorithm assumes
    that the signal is the first properly detectable sound in
    the sample and also that it starts with a rising edge.
    The detection is based on locating the first negative
    valued half wave (the second half wave) and working backwards
    from that using zero crossings and wave duration to pinpoint
    the onset.

    Parameters:
    frames: the sound sample
    sampling_frequency: the sampling frequency of the sound sample
    b and a: high pass filter parameters to remove the electrical
        mains' interference
    name: name identifying the sample. Usually the filename.
